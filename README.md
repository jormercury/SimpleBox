# SimpleBox
SimpleBox is a multimedia mass balance model of the so-called ‘Mackay type’. It simulates environmental fate of chemicals as fluxes (mass flows) between a series of well-mixed boxes of air, water, sediment and soil on regional, continental and global spatial scales.

This repository if for files, e.g. in R to handle different functions of the model. First is an R script to better use the dynamic function of SimpleBox instead having to rely on RExcell.
